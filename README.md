Hi, Iâ€™m Kush, a Software Developer based in Sydney. After deciding a career as an Actuary wasn't for me, I went into the technology space focusing on creating exciting customer experiences. 

I'm obsessed with truly understanding customer needs, focusing on what's important, and ensuring my work is presented in a creative, professional manner (refer to The Apple Marketing Philosophy).

I also read books, write regularly on my Substack, lift weights, and run long distances.
